For Assembly 2013 4k intro compo. Compo release is for FreeBSD-ia32, but
I think Linux-ia32 should be possible. We did not have such a machine
available, if anyone wants to try, please go ahead.

Thanks to Juho Vähä-Herttua for a pointer towards code by parcelshit and
las / Mercury, that made the import-by-hash possible. Also obviously
thanks to these persons for the code that was used as basis. More
detailed information in the sources, read if interested.

We forgot to actually write this README for the party release, but
greets to everyone anyways.
